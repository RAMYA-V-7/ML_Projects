**Goal of the project** - In this project , we will analyze chest X-ray images and accurately identify whether the patient has pneumonia or not.

**Data Collection**
- A large dataset of chest X-ray images is collected. This dataset should include images with and without pneumonia, with various severities.

**Data Preprocessing**
- Images are resized to a standard format and converted to a suitable computer-readable format.

**CNN Model Building**
- A CNN architecture is chosen or designed
- The CNN is trained on the labeled chest X-ray dataset. During training, the CNN learns to identify patterns in the images that differentiate between pneumonia and healthy lungs.

**Model Evaluation**
- The trained CNN model is evaluated on a separate dataset of chest X-rays to assess its accuracy in pneumonia detection.
- Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used for evaluation.
